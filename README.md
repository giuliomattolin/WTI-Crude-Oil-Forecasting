# Forecasting WTI Crude Oil Spot Prices

## Project Objective

In this work, the problem of forecasting the spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was addressed by considering and comparing two different approaches, performing both an econometric and a neural network analysis. Historic data about multiple variables over a period of 23 years were collected and preprocessed in order to organize and clean them. In the econometric analysis, GARCH models were used to extract conditional volatilities and linear models were used to forecast WTI spot prices. On the other hand, in the neural network analysis, a LSTM-based model was used to take into account the sequentiality of the data.
